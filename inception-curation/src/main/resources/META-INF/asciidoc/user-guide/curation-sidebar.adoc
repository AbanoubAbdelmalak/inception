= Curation

Curation i.e. the process of combining finished annotated documents into a final curated document,
can be done via the *Curation Page* in INCEpTION (see <<curation.adoc>>) 
but also via the *Curation Sidebar* on the *Annotation Page*.

The sidebar allows the user to select the users whose annotations she wants to inspect 
and merge into the final document. Annotations from other users are shown in gray above the user's annotations when
the user clicks *Apply* under the user selection. 
The user can decide to *manually* or *automatically* merge their 
annotations into either her own document or a separate _Curation User Document_ as the final document.

The user can always copy annotations *manually* from other users into the curation document by clicking on them.
The *automatic* merge can be triggered by clicking *Re-Merge*. It will copy all annotations that 
all selected users agree on into the curation document.
