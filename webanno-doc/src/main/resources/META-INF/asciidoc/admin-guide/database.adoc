== Database

{product-name} uses an SQL database to store project and user data. 

{product-name} uses by default an embedded HSQLDB database. However, we recommend using the embedded
database only for testing purposes. For production use, we recommend using a MySQL server. The reason
for this is, that:

* some users have reported that HSQLDB databases may become corrupt when the computer crashes
  (note that this could probably also happen with MySQL, but we did so far not have any reports
  about this);
* most {product-name} developers use MySQL when running {product-name} on their servers;
* in the past, we had cases where we described in-place upgrade procedures that required performing
  SQL commands to change the data model as part of the upgrade. We promise to try avoiding this in
  the future. However, in case we offer advice on fixing anything directly in the database, this
  advice will refer to a MySQL database.

We try to keep the data model simple, so there should be no significant requirements to the database
being used. Theoretically, it should be possible to use any JDBC-compatible database after adding a
corresponding driver to the classpath and configuring {product-name} to use the driver in the
`settings.properties` file.

=== Using MySQL in production

This section explains some settings that can be added to the `database.url` in the 
`settings.properties` file when using MySQL. Settings are separated from the host name and database
name with a `?` character and multiple settings are separated using the `&` character, e.g.:

----
database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/webanno?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
----

To suppress the warning about non-SSL database connections with recent MySQL databases, append the
following setting to the `database.url`:

----
useSSL=false
----

Recent MySQL drivers may refuse to work unless a database server timezone has been specified. The
easiest way to do this is to add the following setting to the `database.url`: 

----
serverTimezone=UTC
----

If you plan to use UTF-8 encoding for project name and tagset/tag name, make sure either of the following settings for MySQL database

* in the `settings.properties` file, make sure that `database.url` includes 
+
----
useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8
----

* change the `my.conf` MySQL databse configuration file to include the following line
+
----
character-set-server = utf8
----

=== Using HSQLDB in production

{product-name} displays a warning in the user interface when an embedded database is being used. In case
that you really want to run {product-name} with an embedded database in production, you probably want to
disable this warning. To do so, please add the following entry to the `settings.properties` file:

----
warnings.embeddedDatabase=false
----
