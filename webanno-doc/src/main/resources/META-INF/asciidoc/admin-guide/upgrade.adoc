= Upgrading


In general, it is possible to perform an in-place upgrade of the application. However, before doing
an upgrade, it is recommender to create a backup of the application and data to allow coming back
to a working system if case of a problem during the upgrade. Mind that the upgrade is only completed
once the new version has successfully started because during startup, the application may make
changes to the database schema or to the data on disk.
