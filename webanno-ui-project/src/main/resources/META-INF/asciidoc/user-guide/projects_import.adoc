== Import

NOTE: This functionality is only available to *administrators*.

Projects are associated with the accounts of users that act as project managers, annotators, or
curators. When importing a previously exported project, you can choose to automatically *generate
missing users* (enabled by default). If this option is disabled, projects still maintain their
association to users by name. If the respective user accounts are created manually after the import,
the users will start showing up in the projects.

NOTE: Generated users are disabled and have no password. They must be explicitly enabled and a
      password must be set before the users can log in again.
