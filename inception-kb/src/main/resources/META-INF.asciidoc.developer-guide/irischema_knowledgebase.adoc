=== Knowledge Base -  IRI Schema

An IRI Schema defines the following attributes that are used for making queries in a knowledge base.

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
| Attribute
| Description
| Example Value

| Class IRI
| Class of resources that are classes.
| rdfs:Class

| Subclass IRI
| Property that defines a *subclass of* relation between classes.
| rdfs:subClassOf

| Type IRI
| Property that defines which class a resource belongs to
| rdf:type

| Label IRI
| Property that defines a human readable label for a class or instance
| rdfs:label

| Description IRI
| Property that defines a description for a class or instance
| rdfs:comment

| Property IRI
| Class of resources that are properties
| rdf:Property

| Subproperty IRI
| Property that defines a *subproperty of* relation between properties.
| rdfs:subPropertyOf

| PropertyLabel IRI
| Property that defines a human readable label for a property
| rdfs:label

| PropertyDescription IRI
| Property that defines a description for a property
| rdfs:comment

|===
There are multiple classes in the knowledge base module that model the IRI Schema of a knowledge base. These classes are similar but have different use cases.
Note that if the structure of the general IRI Schema is changed (e.g. a new attribute is added) all of the classes need to be adjusted.

.KnowledgeBase.java
This class is used as a general model for a knowledge base in frontend and backend components. It has a sinlge class-attribute  for each IRI in the IRI schema.

.KnowledgeBaseProfile.java / KnowledgeBaseMapping.java
These classes are used to read pre-configured knowledgebase profiles from a yaml file.
The actual IRI Schema is modeled in KnowledgeBaseMapping.java.
The yaml file is located at:

.IriSchema.java
This class defines some specific IRI Schemas. (e.g RDF, WIKIDATA, SKOS).

.ExportedKnowledgeBase.java
This class is used to export a knowledgebase configuration when a project is exported.
