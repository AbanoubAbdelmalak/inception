== Relations

To create a relation annotation, click on a span annotation and drag the mouse to another span
annotation. While you drag, an arc is drawn. It is not possible to create arbitrary relation
annotations. In order to create one, a corresponding relation layer needs to be defined between
the source and target spans.

Depending on the layer behavior configuration, relation annotations can stack, can cross each other,
and can cross sentence boundaries.

.Self-looping relations
To create a relation from a span to itself, press the *SHIFT* key before starting to drag the mouse
and hold it until you release the mouse button.

To abort the creation of an annotation, hold the *CTRL* key when you release the mouse button.

NOTE: Currently, there can be at most one relation layer per span layer. Relations between spans
      of different layers are not supported.

NOTE: Not all arcs displayed in the annotation view are belonging to chain or relation layers. Some
      are induced by <<sect_annotation_link_features>>.

When moving the mouse over an annotation with outgoing relations, the info popup includes the
*yield* of the relations. This is the text transitively covered by the outgoing relations. This
is useful e.g. in order to see all text governed the head of a particular dependency relation.
The text may be abbreviated.
