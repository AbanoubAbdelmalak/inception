== Running the standalone behind a reverse proxy

These are *optional* instructions if you want to run {product-name} behind an Apache web-server instead of accessing it directly.

These guides assumes Debian 9.1 (Stretch) as the operating system.
For the optional SSL configuration, it further assumes that you want to use link:https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt] as a CA for obtaining valid SSL certificates.
