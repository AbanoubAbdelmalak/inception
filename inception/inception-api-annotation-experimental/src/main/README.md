A Typescript API for text annotation. 

<br/>
<br/>

## Using the API
In order to use the API for your custom annotation editor, create a typescript file
that imports the index.ts file located in:

"inception-api-annotation-experimental/src/main/ts"

and assign a variable to create the object. 

var API = new Experimental()



### API endpoints


### Additional information
When the API is invoked, a websocket connection between the client (browser) and server will
also be created automatically. You can configure the URL that is used
in the "config.json" file.
