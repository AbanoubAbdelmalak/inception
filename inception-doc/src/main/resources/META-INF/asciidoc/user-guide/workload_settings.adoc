[[sect_workload_settings]]
= Workload settings

NOTE: This functionality is only available when the experimental feature dynamic-workload is enabled.

This configuration tab for a project enables the utilization of the dynamic workload feature. The dropbox lets
the project manager choose, whether the standard monitoring or the dynamic workload feature shall be used.
There can only be one of them in use at any given time.
Upon selecting the dynamic workload from the dropdown and confirming it with the corresponding button, the
project manager is able to select the new workload tab from the projects menu bar.
