[[sect_workload]]
= Workload

NOTE: This functionality is only available when the experimental feature dynamic-workload is enabled.

Similar to the monitoring page, the workload page shall give project manager a fast overview of all documents
and users within the current project.

Therefore, it mainly consists of a substantial, but easy to understand table containing the data a project manager
needs from their documents.
Overall, there are three different tabs which enable advanced features for the workload page.
. Filters: Different filters can be applied here to make the table easier to read and get faster the required information needed.
. Annotators: In this menu, a project manager is able to execute different tasks regarding the annotators of the project. For example,
specific documents can be assigned to an annotator, or if an annotator has accidentally finished a document he / she was working
on, the project manager can reset the documents status.
. Settings: The final tab gives a project manager the opportunity to select values for two different categories.
The first one is the default number of annotations. This number is crucial for the documents distribution, as each document can
only be assigned to annotators at a maximum of this number.
The second option is the workflow for the documents. Right now, a project manager can select from two different workflow
strategies.
Default workflow means, that the documents are simply passed to the annotators in same the way as they are also represented in the table.
Randomized workflow, as the name already explains, selects randomly from all documents each time a new document is requested by an annotator.
