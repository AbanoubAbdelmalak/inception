= Getting Started

This Getting-Started-Guide helps new users to install, start and work
with INCEpTION. It gives a quick overview (estimated time for reading
only: approx. 15-20 minutes) on the key functionalities in order to get
familiar with the tool. It excludes special cases and details due to
simplicity and focus on the first steps. For further reading on any
topic, see our main documentation:
https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide. For quick overviews, also see our tutorial
videos (Topics: Introduction, Overview, Recommender Basics, Entity
Linking):

== Introduction

What can INCEpTION be used for? (also see our https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&time_continue=135&v=Ely8eBKqiSI&feature=emb_logo)[introduction video] for a
first impression what INCEpTION is):


* **INCEpTION is a text-annotation enviroment **useful for various kinds
of annotation projects. It is a web application in which several users
can work on the same project and it can hold several annotation projects
at a time. The core functionality is annotating any kind of written
text. Annotations can be used both for linguistic and machine learning
concerns.image:Pictures/10000201000002B300000214EA8A80D173D21C1E.png[image,width=567,height=436]
In the following picture, you see an example where so called entities
have been annotated as person (PER), location (LOC), organization (ORG)
or other (OTH). These aspects are annotated on the annotation layer
Named Entity. We will go more into what layers are later on. TELL,
WHERE!
* *What‘s more on INCEpTION* is that it combines three key features in
one plattform: Creating a corpus to be annotated (*Corpus Creation*);
annotating it and merging annotations made by several annotators
(*Annotation, Curation*); and managing the knowledge used for annotating
(*Knowledge Bases*.) You may want to do one, two or all three steps with
INCEpTION. Also, it is extendable and adoptable to individual
requrements in all of these three areas. Here are some examples: You may
integrate a knowledgebase of your choice; create and modify your own
knowledge base; create and modify own layers and tagsets for annotation;
build own so called „recommenders“ to suggest annotations so you will
work quicker and easier; .…
+
This guide focuses on enabeling you to annotate. For details on any
other topic, see our main documentation
https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide.

Tell us what you would like to have

* INCEpTION is still in developement, so you are welcome to give us
feedback and tell us your wishes and requirements. For any questions,
you are welcome to join our Google group „inception users“:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/inception-users
* If you have questions, you can
** reach us via the INCEpTION Users mailing list:
inception-users@googlegroups.com
** or open an issue on Github:
https://github.com/inception-project/inception/issues

Know our documentation for further reading

* You will find lots of information in our guides, called documentation
(on our website, among the tabs on top: → _Documentation:_
https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half. If you only use INCEpTION and do not develop, the User
Guide is the one of your choice). If these do not answer your question,
don‘t hesitate to contact our team (see above). We are glad to help you.
* Whenever you find a blue questionmark-sign in INCEpTION, you may click
on it to find further explanation in the main documentation.
* For more installation details, see the admin guide. You find it on our
website, among the tabs on top:→ _Documentation_,
https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ Admin Guide.
* If you develop, the Developer Guide might be interesting for you (
https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ Developer Guide).

Installing and starting INCEpTION

Installing Java

* In order to run INCEpTION, you need to have Java installed in version
8 or higher. If you do not have it installed yet, you find instructions
here:
link:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle
Java] or here: link:https://adoptopenjdk.net[OpenJDK]

Download and start INCEpTION

* Now, download the .jar-file from our website
https://inception-project.github.io/downloads/ by clicking on
https://github.com/inception-project/inception/releases/download/inception-app-0.16.1/inception-app-standalone-0.16.1.jar[INCEpTION
0.16.1 (executable JAR)] . Wait a moment until it is fully downloaded.
That is, until the name of the downlauded folder ends on „.jar“, not on
„.jar.part“ anymore.
+
_Note_: We recommend working on the latest version always since we
constantly add new features, improve usability and fix bugs. After
downloading the latest Version, your previous work will not be lost: In
the new version, you will find all your projects and documents like
before. Check the website, subscribe to github notifications or the
google group to to be notified when new versions are released.

* Now, simply ***double-click ***on the downloaded .jar-file. After a
moment, a splash screen will display while the application is
initializing.
+
image:Pictures/100002010000042B0000022048C4B1144148DA3D.png[image,width=575,height=290]
+
Once the initialization is complete, a dialog appears. Here, you can
open the application in your default browser or shut it down again.

image:Pictures/10000201000002490000008B40781F820877441E.png[image,width=580,height=135]

* If you prefer the command line, you may enter this command there
instead:
+
$ java -jar inception-app-standalone-0.10.0.jar
+
In this case, no splash screen will start. Just enter
http://localhost:8080/[_http://localhost:8080_] in you browser.
* The first time you start the application, a default user with the
username „admin“ and the password „admin“ is created. Use this username
and password to log in to the application after opening it in your
vrowser
* In case you are interested in more installation details, see the Admin
Guide. You find it on our website, among the tabs on top: →
_Documentation_,

, upper half→ Admin Guide.

First Steps with INCEpTION

In this section, we will make first annotations and therefore use an
already existing annotation project (so called „example project“). We
will not go into theory and background. In case you want to learn first
how INCEpTION is built genereally, we recommend reading the section
„Anatomy of an annotation project“ first.

*Download an example project for your first annotations*

We created some annotation projects as examples of how to annotate with
INCEpTION. You find them in the section „Example Projects“ on our
website. The tab on the very top leads you to the following page:
https://inception-project.github.io/example-projects/ .

image:Pictures/10000201000002E0000000C72F4B75B5F9EAE8D0.png[image,width=636,height=128]

* To follow this Guide, please *download* the _Interactive Concept
Linking_ project. It constists of two documents about pets which contain
already some annotations as an example. It has originally been created
to show an example for concept linking (annotating if something is a
Person (PER), Organization (ORG), Location (LOC) or something else
(other: OTH)) but in every project, you can create any kinds of
annotations.

image:Pictures/100002010000045200000212EF2BD2132E62C7BC.png[image,width=643,height=295]

* In order to *import our example project*, after logging into
INCEpTION, click on the blue folder on the top right (next to „Import
project archives“) and browse for the example project you have
downloaded before. Finally, click the grey upload-Button right next to
the blue folder to upload the selected project.

Create your first annotations

You may want to watch our *tutorial video „Overview“* on how to create
annotation:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp4AN3p23mQ&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&index=3&t=0s[https://www.youtube.com/watch?]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp4AN3p23mQ&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&index=3&t=0s[v=wp4AN3p23mQ&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&index=3&t=0s]
. But this guide, too, will lead you step by step.

* The project has now been added. Choose it by clicking on its name and
you will be on the dashboard of this project.

* You will see several annotations already. If you import projects (or
also, single documents, as we see in section „anatomy of a project“ →
documents) without any annotations, there will be none. But in the
example projects, we have added some annotations already to show you
some examples of annotations.
* To create your first annotation, let‘s start with Part of Speech
Tagging – since it is a simple kind of annotation and we can make any
kind of annotation in any project. Select *POS* from the *Layer*
dropdown on the top right. When you click on a word in the text (e.g.
„does“, in line 4), an annotation is immediately created and you can
edit its details in the panels at the right (e.g. choose „VERB“ in the
PosValue-dropdown to lable it as a verb).

Congratulations! You have created your first annotation!

* Now, let‘s examine the right panel to understand what we have done:

* {blank}
** You find the field „Layer“ on top and „Annotation“ below. In the
*Layer*-dropdown, you can choose the layer you want to annotate with as
we yust did. By the layer, you choose the kind of annotation you make.
For example, we used the POS (Part of Speech) layer before to annotate
what is a verb/noun/adjective/… On the
** You find several default layers like Part Of Speech or Named Entity
already. You can also adjust them and create own layers in the project
settings (we will deal with the project settings later on). INCEpTION
supports span layers (annotating a span in the text, e.g. from the 51th
character („letter“) in the text to the 55th) and relation layers
(annotating two span annotations). For span layers, the default is to
always annotate one or more tokens („words“) but you can adjust to
character level or sentence level. For more details, see the main
documentation (
https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide).
** In the field *Annotation* below, you see the details of a selected
annotation. It shows the layer the annotation is made on (field „layer“)
and what has been annotated (field „text“). Below, you can see and
modify what has been entered for each of the so called *Features*. Each
layer has different features. E.g. on the Part of Speech-layer, the
PosValue-feature tells if the token is a noun/verb/adjective/… See the
main documentation for the different feature types and how to adjust
features for your individual task
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide).
+
You may enter free text here or work with *Tagsets* to have a well
defined set of values to enter. You can modify and create tagsets in the
project settings (section „Tagsets“) which we will deal with later. See
our main documentation on how to create and modify tagsets
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide).
* In the **Annotation Sidebar **at the left (it folds out when clicking
on the little arrow on top) there are several features you might want to
check the main documentation for
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide). Especially the *Recommender* section (the
black speech bubble) is worth a look if you use recommenders
(recommenders will be explained later on in this guide). E.g. you find
their measures and learning behaviours. Note the *Search* (the magnifier
glass): You can create or delete annotations on all or some of the
search results.
* To get familiar with INCEpTION, you may want to follow the
instructions for your example-project which are on the website where you
downloaded it or explore INCEpTION yourself, learning by doing.
+
One way or the other: *Have fun exploring*!

ERGÄNZE Tagsets:

INCEpTION comes with many different built-in layers and annotation
schemes. You can explore these in the Project settings under Layer and
Tagset.

 +
ich würd vorschlagen den leser drauf hinzuweisen dass er eigene tagsets
anlegen kann und auch soll

es gibt built-in layer - die kann man auch nicht löschen

es gibt keine built-in tagsets in dem sinne dass man sie nicht löschen
kann

aber es gibt "default" tagsets - die halt per default angelegt werden
damit der benutzer einen startpunkt hat

=== Anatomy of an annotation project

If you may have different projects in {product-name} at the same time. Each
project consist of

* One or more *documents* to annotate
* *Users* to work on the project
* *Layers* to annotate with
* Optional: one or more *Knowledge Base/s*
* Optional: *Recomenders* to automatically suggest annotations
* Optional: *Guidelines* for your team

You find all of these in the project *settings* which are explaned in
the next part.

In order to work with your own projects, you might want to understand
the anatomy of an {product-name} project. Let‘s see what the dashboard
(clicking on the dashboard button on the top) provides: As a Project
Manager of a project, you see all of the following sub pages (roles and
rights will be presented later on in this guide). For details on each
section, check the main documentation
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide).

* *Annotation*: We were here before. Here, you can make your
annotations just like before.
* *Curation*: If several annotators work on a project, you may want a
curator to finally decide which annotations to accept. Everyone with
curation rights (see below) within this project can curate. All others
do not have access to nor see this page. Only documents marked as
finished by at least one annotator can be curated. For details on how to
courate, see the main documentation
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide) or just try it out:

** Add another fake user (see below)
** Create some annotations in any document
** Mark the document as finished: Just click on the lock on top.
** Log out and log in again as the fake user.
** In the very same document, make some annotations exactly like before
but also some which are different. Mark the document as finished.
** Log in as any user with couration rights (e.g. the „admin“ user we
used before), enter the couration page and explore how to courate: You
see the automatic merge on top (what was equal from both users is being
accepted already) and the annotations of each of the users below.
Differences are highlightet. You can accept an annotation by clicking on
it. You can also create new annotations.
* *Knowledge Base*: On this sub page, you can manage and create your
knowledge bases for this project. You can create new ones from the
scratch, modify existing ones and integrate remote or local knowledge
bases into your project.
* *Monitoring:* Here you can check the overall progress of your
project; which user is working on or has finished which document; and
for each user, you can toggle the status of each document between
***Done****/****In Progress ****or between **New / Locked**.***
* *Agreement*: On this page, you can calculate the agreement of you
annotators‘ work. Four different measures for agreement are provided.
_Note:_ Only documents marked as finished by annotators (clicking on the
little lock on the annotation page) are taken into account.
* *Evaluation*: The evaluation page shows a learning courve diagram of
each recommender (we will explain recommenders later on on this guide).
* *Settings*: This is the heart of your project. Here, you can
organize, manage and adjust all details of your project. We will look at
the ones you need to get started for your own projects. For a quick
overview on the settings, you might want to watch our tutorial video
„Overview“:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp4AN3p23mQ&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&index=3&t=0s.

* Now, let‘s have a look at the *Settings* (again, for details on any
section/topic mentioned, please check the main documentation
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide).** **You find differenat tabs:

* In the section **Documents, **you may upload your files to be
annotated. Make sure that the format selected (see the dropdown on the
right) is the same as the file.
* In the section **Users, **you may add users to your project and change
their rights in this project. You can only add existing users here from
the dropdown (left).
** In order to *add new users* so they can be chosen from this dropdown,
click on „*administration*“- button in the very top right corner and
select section *Users* on the left. For *user roles* (within the whole
instance of INCEpTION) see
https://zoidberg.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/jenkins/job/INCEpTION%20(GitHub)%20(master)/de.tudarmstadt.ukp.inception.app$inception-app-webapp/doclinks/1/#sect_users
** *Selecting a user from the dropdown* in the project settings section
*Users*, you can check/unchek the *user‘s rights *(they are different
from roles and count for this project only) on the right side. Any
combination is possible and the user will always have _all_ rights
combined.

* In the section **Layers, **you may modify existing layers to use for
your annotation and create own layers. In case you do not want to work
on default layers only, we highly recommend reading the main
documentation on layers
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide).
* In the section **Knowledge Base, **you can change the settings for the
knowledge bases used in your project and also import local and remote
knowledgebases or create a new one. Herefore, just click the
„create“-button and follow the wizzard.
** Note that you can have several knowledge bases in your INCEpTION
instance but you can choose for every project which one(s) to use. Using
many knowledge bases in one project will slow down the performance.
** Via the *Dashboard* (click the Dashboard-button at the top centre),
you can get to the knowledge base page. This is a page different from
the one in the project settings where you can modify and work on your
knowledge bases.
** For details on knowledge bases, see our main documentation
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide) or our tutorial video „Overview“ which also
talks about knowledge bases quickly:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp4AN3p23mQ&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&index=3&t=0s..
If you like to explore a knowledge base learning by doing, you may
download and import the example project _Interactive Concept Linking_:
https://inception-project.github.io/example-projects/concept-linking/
which contains a small knowledge base.
* In the section **Recommenders, **you can create and modify your
recommenders. They learn from your behaviour and give automatic
suggestions for creating annotations. For details on this topic to broad
for a getting-started-guide, see our main documentation
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide) or our tutorial video „Recommender Basics“:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz3Hs8Lyoeg&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&index=3
.

* In the *Guidelines* section, you may import guideline files for your
team to read and to check quickly while working. On the annotation page
(→ _dashboard_ → _annotation_ → open any document), everyone can quickly
look them up by clicking on the guidelines button on the top (it looks
like a book).

* We have imported a whole project already (the example project) as well
as single documents (in the **documents **section). In the **Export
**section, you can export your project partially or wholly. Projects
which have been exported can be imported again in INCEpTION the way we
did before: at the start page with the *Import* button. We recommend
exporting projects on a regular basis in order to have a backup. For the
different formats, their strengths and weaknesses, check our main
documentation
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide). We recommend using WebAnno TSV x.x (where
x.x. is the highest number available, e.g. 3.2) whenever possible. Since
it has been created specially for this application, it ill provide all
features required best. However, many other formats are provided.

We hope this guide helped you with your first steps on INCEpTION and it
gave you a general idea of hiw INCEpTION works. As mentioned before, our
main documentation
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide) provides deep information on every issue.
Don‘t hestitate to contact us if you struggle or have any questions. We
wish you success and fun with your projects. Let us know how you are
doing!
