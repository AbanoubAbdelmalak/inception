= Getting Started
:toc:

This Getting-Started-Guide helps new users to install, start and work with {product-name}. It gives a quick overview (estimated time for reading only: approx. 20-30 minutes) on the key functionalities in order to get familiar with the tool. It excludes special cases and details due to
simplicity and focus on the first steps. <<Know Our Documentation For Further Reading>> on any
topic. You are already in the User Guide document. The main documentation of this User Guide starts right after the Getting Started section: <<{product-name} User Guide>>.

For quick overviews, also see our https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-[four tutorial videos] covering an Introduction, an Overview, Recommender Basics and Entity Linking. Getting Started will refer to them wherever it might be helpful.

NOTE: *Note-boxes:* In this Getting Started guide, the note-boxes provide additional information. They may be skipped for fast reading if background knowledge exists and/or they may be consulted later on for checkups on basic concepts.

After the intorduction, Getting Started leads you to using {product-name} in three steps: First, we will see how to install it <<Installing and Starting INCEpTION>>; second, for a basic orientation and understanding, the structure of {product-name} and a project is explained in <<Settings and Structure Of An Annotation Project>>; and third, you will be guided to make your first annotations.



== Introduction

=== What can {product-name} be used for?

For a first impression on what {product-name} is, you may want to watch our https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&time_continue=135&v=Ely8eBKqiSI&feature=emb_logo)[introduction video].


{product-name} is a *text-annotation enviroment* useful for various kinds
of annotation projects. It is a web application in which several users
can work on the same annotation project and it can hold several annotation projects
at a time. The core functionality is annotating written
text. Annotations are usually used for linguistic and/or machine learning
concerns.
The following picture might give you a first impression on how annotated texts look like. In this example, text spans have been annotated as whether they refer to a person (PER), location (LOC), organization (ORG) or any other (OTH).

image:getting_started_example_for_annotations.png[image,width=567,height=436]

What‘s more on {product-name} beyond annotating written text is that it combines three key features in one plattform: First, before you annotate, you need a corpus to be annotated (*Corpus Creation*). You might have one already or create it yourself. Both works with {product-name}. Second, you might want to annotate the corpus (*Annotation*) and/or merge the annotations which different annotators made (*Curation*). Third, you might want to manage the knowledge used for annotating
(*Knowledge Bases*). You can do all three steps with
{product-name} or only one or two. In addition, {product-name} is extendable and adoptable to individual
requrements. Often, it provides predefined elements, like knowledge bases, layers and tagsets (see the note-boxes in section <<Project Settings>>) to give you a starting point but you can also modify them or create your own from the scrach. You may for example integrate a knowledge base of your choice; create and modify your own knowledge base; create and modify own layers and tagsets to annotate your individual task; build own so called recommenders which automatically suggest annotations to you so you will work quicker and easier; and much more.

Getting Started focuses on annotating. For details on any
other topic like Corpus Creation or the like, see the main documentation part of this User Guide: <<INCEpTION User Guide>>.

=== Do You Have Questions or Feedback?

{product-name} is still in developement, so you are welcome to give us feedback and tell us your wishes and requirements.

* For many questions, you find answers in the *main documentation*: <<{product-name} User Guide>>.

* You are welcome to join our *Google group* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/inception-users[„inception users“].

* Or consider the {product-name} users *mailing list*: inception-users@googlegroups.com

* You can also open an *issue on https://github.com/inception-project/inception/issues[Github]*.



=== Know Our Documentation For Further Reading
Our main documentation consists of three parts: 

NOTE: *User Guide-Shortcuts:* Whenever you find a *blue questionmark*-sign in {product-name}, you may click on it to be linked to the respective section of the User Guide.

* *User Guide*: If you only use {product-name} and do not develop, the User Guide beginning right after Getting Started is the one of your choice: <<{product-name} User Guide>>. If it does not answer your questions, don't hesitate to contact us (see <<Do You Have Questions or Feedback?>>). 

* *Admin Guide*: For more installation details, see the https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/latest/admin-guide[Admin Guide].

* *Developer Guide*: {product-name} is open source. So if you would like to develop, the https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/latest/developer-guide[Developer Guide] might be interesting for you.


== Installing and Starting INCEpTION

=== Installing Java

In order to run {product-name}, you need to have Java installed on your system, version 8 or higher. If you do not have Java installed yet, please install the latest link:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle Java] or link:https://adoptopenjdk.net[OpenJDK]. Both work perfectly fine so you can choose either of them.


=== Download And Start {product-name}

In this section , we will download and install {product-name} in three steps.

NOTE: *Working on the Latest Version:* We recommend working on the latest version always since we constantly add new features, improve usability and fix bugs. After
downloading the latest version, your previous work will not be lost: In
the new version, you will find all your projects, documents, users etc. like
before without doing anything.+
Check the website, subscribe to github notifications or the
google group to to be notified when a new version has been released.

*Step 1 - Download:* Download the .jar-file from our
https://inception-project.github.io/downloads/[website] by clicking on
https://github.com/inception-project/inception/releases/download/inception-app-0.16.1/inception-app-standalone-0.16.1.jar[{product-name}
0.16.1 (executable JAR)]. Wait a moment until it has been fully downloaded.
That is, until the name of the downloaded folder ends on „.jar“, not on
„.jar.part“ anymore.


NOTE: *In Case {product-name} Does Not Start:* If double-clicking the JAR file does not start {product-name}, you might need to first make the file executable. Right-click on the JAR file and navigate throught the settings and permissions. There, you can mark it as executable.


*Step 2 - Open (via double-click):* Now, simply double-click on the downloaded .jar-file. After a
moment, a splash screen will display while the application is
initializing.

image:getting_started_starting_the_jar_I.png[image,width=575,height=290]

Once the initialization is complete, a dialog appears. Here, you can open the application in your default browser or shut it down again.

image:getting_started_starting_the_jar_II.png[image,width=580,height=135]

*Step 2 - Open (via terminal):* If you prefer the command line, you may enter this command there
instead of double-clicking. Make sure that instead of "x.xx.x", you enter the version you downloaded:

$ java -jar inception-app-standalone-x.xx.x.jar

In this case, no splash screen will start. Just enter
http://localhost:8080/[_http://localhost:8080_] in you browser.

*Step 3 - Log in: * The first time you start the application, a default user with the *username „admin“* and the *password „admin“* is created. Use this username and password to log in to the application.

*You have finished the installation.*


*Final notes:*

** {product-name} is designed for the browsers *Chrome, Safari and Firebird*. It does work in other browsers as well but for these three, we can support you best.

** For more installation details, see the https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[Admin Guide] (upper half→ *Admin Guide*).


==== Download an Example Project

In order to understand what you read in this guide, it makes sense to have an annotation project to look at so we created some example projects. You find them in the section https://inception-project.github.io/example-projects/[Example Projects] on our website.

image:getting_started_download_example_project.png[image,width=636,height=128]

NOTE: *Concept Linking:* This is the kind of annotation telling whether the annotated text part refers to a
Person (in {product-name}, it will per default get the tag PER), Organization (ORG), Location (LOC) or any other (OTH). +
The respective layer to annotate this aspect is the _Named Entity_ layer. If you are not sure what layers are, check the box on _Layers And Features_ in the section <<Project Settings>>.

* For this guide, we use the _Interactive Concept Linking_ project. It constists of two documents about pets. The first one contains some annotations as an example, the second one is meant to be your playground. It has originally been created for concept linking annotation but in every project, you can create any kinds of annotations.
 

* In order to *import our example project*, after logging into
{product-name}, click on the blue folder on the top right (next to „Import
project archives“) and browse for the example project you have
downloaded before. Finally, click the grey upload button right next to
the blue folder to upload the selected project. The project has now been added.


== Settings and Structure Of An Annotation Project
In this section, we will have a look on the structure of every annotation project in {product-name}. If you prefer to make some annotations first, you may skip this section, go on with <<First Annotations with {product-name}>> and return later. This section here gives you a basic orientation in {product-name}.

You may have different projects in {product-name} at the same time. First, let‘s see what elements each project _has_ and where you can adjust these elements. Second, we will find out what you can _do_ in each project.


=== Project Settings

Each project consists of the following elements:

* one or (usually) more *Documents* to annotate
* one or (usually) more *Users* to work on the project
* one or (usually) more *Layers* to annotate with
* Optional: one or more *Knowledge Base/s*
* Optional: *Recomenders* to automatically suggest annotations
* Optional: *Guidelines* for you and your team

For a quick overview on the settings, you might want to watch our tutorial video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp4AN3p23mQ&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&index=3&t=0s[Overview].
As for all topics of Getting Started, you will find more details on each of them in the man documentation <<{product-name} User Guide>>.


The Settings provide a tab for each of them. You reach the settings after logging in when you click on the name of a project and then on "Settings" on the left. If you have not imported the example project yet, we propose to follow the instruction in <<Download an Example Project>> first.

NOTE: *Formats:* For details on the different formats, {product-name} provides for importing and exporting single documents as well as whole projects, you may check the main documentation, <<Appendix A: Formats>>.

* *Documents:* Here, you may upload your files to be annotated. Make sure that the format selected (see the dropdown on the
right) is the same as the file.



NOTE: *{product-name} Instance vs. Project:* In some cases, we have to distinguish between the {product-name} *instance* we are working in and the *project(s)* it contains. Like here, a user may be added to the {product-name} instance but not to a certain project. Or she may have different rights in several projects.

* *Users*: Here, you may add users to your _project_ and change
their rights within that project. You can only add users to a project from the dropdown at the left if they exist already in the {product-name} _instance_.

** *Add new users:* In order to find users for a _project_ in the dropdown, you need to add them to your {product-name} _instance_ first. Click on the *administration*- button in the very top right corner and
select section *Users* on the left. For *user roles* (for an _instance_ of {product-name}) see the <<User Management>> in the main documentation.

** *Giving rights to users:* After selecting a user from the dropdown in the project settings section *Users*, you can check and uncheck the user‘s rights on the right side. User rights count for that _project_ only and are different from user roles which count for the whole {product-name} _instance_. Any combination of rights is possible and the user will always have the sum of all rights given.

NOTE: *Layers and Features:* There are different "aspects" or "categories" you might want to annotate. For example, you might want to annotate all the places and persons in a text and link them to a knowledge base entry see <<Structure Of An Annotation Project>> -> Knowledge Base). This way of annotation is called _Named Entity_. In another case, you might want to annotate which words are verbs, nouns, adjectives, prepositions and so on (called _Part of Speech_). What we called "aspects", "categories" or "ways to annotate" here, is referred to as *layers* in {product-name} as in many other annotation tools, too. + 
{product-name} supports *span layers* in order to annotate a span from one character („letter“) in the text to another, *relation layers*
in order to annotate the relation between two span annotations and *chain layers* which are normally used to annotate coreferences, that is, to show that different words or phrases refer to the same person or object. The annotation of a relation layer always anchors on both span annotations. A span layer annotation always anchors in one span only and chains anchor on all spans which are part of the chain. For span layers, the default is to always annotate one or more tokens („words“) but you can adjust to character level or sentence level. +
Each layer provides appropriate fields, so called *features* to enter a lable as what to annotate the selected text part. For example, on the _Named Entity_ layer in product-name}, you find the feature-field _value_ to enter what kind of entity it is ("LOC" for a location, PER for a person, ORG for an organization and OTH for other) and _identifier_ to enter, which exact entity (which must be in the knowledge base) it is. +
{product-name} provides default layers and features to give you a starting point. Default layers cannot be deleted as selfmade layers can. However, new features can be added.
See the https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[main documentation], upper half→ User Guide for details on layers, features, the different types of layers and features and how to adjust them for your individual task.

* *Layers:* In this section, you may modify existing layers to use for
your annotations and also create own layers. In case you do not want to work
on default layers only but wish to have layers designed for your individual task, we recommend reading the
https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[main documentation], upper half→ User Guide.



NOTE: *Tagsets:* In order the annotations all to have consistent labels, it is preferrable to use defined tags which can be given to the annotations. Users then are not tempted to enter the lable as free text which would lead to varying spelling. A set of those defindes tags is called a tagset. It is so to say a collection of lables which can be used for an annotation. {product-name} comes with predefined tagsets out of the box but as many times before. They serve a a suggestion and starting point and you can modify them or create your own as well. Other than the defalut layers, default taggsets can also be deleted.

NOTE: *Feature Types:* The feature type defines what kind of information the feature can be, for example "Primitive: Integer" for whole numbers, "Primitive: Float" for decimals; "Primitive: Boolean" for a true/false lable only; the most common one "Primitive: String" for text lables or "KB: Concept/Instance/Property" if the feature shall be able to link to a knowledge base. There are more types for features but these are the most important ones. +
Changing the type does only work for your own features, not for default features. In order to do so, scroll in the "Feature Details" panel until you see the field "Type" and select the type of your choice.
If a tagset shall be linked to a feature, they must have the same type.
For details, see the section on layers and features in the https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[main documentation], upper half→ User Guide.

* *Tagsets:* Brhind this tab, you can modify and create the tagsets for your layers. Tagsets are always bound to a layer, or more precisely to a certain feature of a layer.
** In order to *create a new tagset*, click on the blue create button on top. Enter a name for and - not technically necessary but highly recommended to make the work between different users of one project earsier - a speking descriprion for the tagset. Check or uncheck "Annotators may add new tags" as you prefer. Now, click on the blue save-button.
** In order to *fill your tagset with tags*, first choose the set from the list on the left. Then, click on the blue create-button on top of the "Tags"-panel at the bottom. A new panel called "Tag Details" opens right beside. Enter a name and description ans click the save-button. The tag has now been added to your set.
** In order to use the tagset, it is necessary to *link it to a layer and feature*. Herefore, click on the *Layers*-tab and select the layer of your choice from the list at the left. Two new panels open: "Layer Details" and "Features". We focus on the second one. Choose the feature your tagset is made for. The panel "Feature details" opens. In this panel, scroll down to "Tagsets" and chose your tagset from the dropdown.
** For more details on Tagsets, see the https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[main documentation], upper half→ User Guide.

*_Note_: Tagsets can be changed and deleted. But the annotations they have been used for will remain.*


NOTE: *Saving:* Some steps, like annotations, are saved automatically in {product-name}. Others need to be saved manually. Whenever there is a blue *save*-button, it is necessary to click it to save the work.


NOTE: *Knowledge Bases* are a data bases for knowledge. Let's assume, the mention "Paris" is to be annotated. There are many different Parises - persons, the capital city of France and more - so the annotation is to tell clearly what entity named Paris is meant here. Herefore, the knowledge base needs to have an entry of the correct entity. The annotation creates a reference to that entry. +
There are knowledge bases on the web ("remote") which can be used with {prodct-name} like e.g. WikiData. One can also create own, new knowledge bases and use them in {product-name}. They will be saved on your device ("local").

* In the section *Knowledge Base*, you can change the settings for the
knowledge bases used in your project, you can import local and remote
knowledgebases into your project and you can create an own knowledge base. The latter will be empty at first. It can be filled at the knowledge base page ( -> _Dashboard_, -> _Knowledge base_, also see <<Structure Of An Annotation Project>> -> Knowledge Base), not here in the settings. In order to import or create a knowledge base, just click the „create“-button and follow the wizzard according to your demands.

** *Note* that you can have several knowledge bases in your INCEpTION
instance but you can choose for every project which one(s) to use. Using
many knowledge bases in one project will slow down the performance.
** Via the Dashboard (click the Dashboard-button at the top centre),
you can get to the *knowledge base page*. This is a page different from
the one in the project settings where you can modify and work on your
knowledge bases.

** *For details* on knowledge bases, see our
https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[main documentation], upper half→ User Guide or our https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp4AN3p23mQ&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&index=3&t=0s../[tutorial video „Overview“] which also
talks about knowledge bases quickly.
If you like to explore a knowledge base learning by doing, you may
download and import the example project
https://inception-project.github.io/example-projects/concept-linking/[_Interactive Concept Linking_] which contains a small knowledge base and which we use in section <<First Annotations with {product-name}>>, too.

* In the section *Recommenders*, you can create and modify your
recommenders. They learn from what the user annotates and gives suggestions. For details on this topic to broad for a getting-started-guide, see our 
https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[ main documentation]
, upper half→ User Guide or our https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz3Hs8Lyoeg&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&index=3/[tutorial video „Recommender Basics“].

* In the *Guidelines* section, you may import files with guideline files. There is no automatic correction or warning from {product-name} but it is a short way for every user in the project to read and check them while working. On the annotation page
(→ _dashboard_ → _annotation_ → open any document), annotators can quickly
look them up by clicking on the guidelines button on the top (it looks
like a book).

* In the *Export* section, you can export your project partially or wholly. Projects
which have been exported can be imported again in INCEpTION the way we
do with our example project in section <<First Annotations with {product-name}>>: at the start page with the *Import* button. We recommend exporting projects on a regular basis in order to have a backup. For the
different formats, their strengths and weaknesses, check our 
https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[main documentation], upper half → User Guide. We recommend using WebAnno TSV x.x (where
x.x. is the highest number available, e.g. 3.2) whenever possible. Since
it has been created specially for this application, it will provide all
features required best. However, many other formats are provided.


=== Structure Of An Annotation Project

Click on the dashboard button on the top. As a Project Manager (see <<User Rights:>>), you see all of the following sub pages. For details on each section, check the <<{product-name} User Guide>>.

* *Annotation*: If you went to <<First Annotations with {product-name}>> before, you have been here already. Here, the annotators can go to to annotate the texts.

NOTE: *Curation:* If several annotators work on a project, their annotations usually do not match perfectly. The process which annotations to finally keep is called Curation.

* *Curation*: Everyone with curation rights (see <<User Rights:>>) within a project can curate it. All other users
do not have access to nor see this page. Only documents marked as
finished by at least one annotator can be curated. For details on how to
curate, see the main documentation -> <<Curation>> or just try it out:

** Create some annotations in any document
** Mark the document as finished: Just click on the lock on top.
** Add another fake user (see <<Project Settings>> -> Users).
** Log out and log in again as the fake user.
** In the very same document, make some annotations which are the same and some which are different than before. Mark the document as finished.
** Log in as any user with curation rights (e.g. the „admin“ user we
used before), enter the curation page and explore how to curate: You
see the automatic merge on top (what was equal from both users has been accepted already) and the annotations of each of the users below.
Differences are highlighted. You can accept an annotation by clicking on
it. 
** As a curator, you can also create new annotations on this page It works exactly like on the Annotation page. Note that users with curation rights only do not see nor have access to the annotation page (see <<User Rights:>>).


* *Knowledge Base*: (also see <<Project Settings>> -> the note-box on knowledge bases) On this page, you can manage and create your
knowledge base(s) for the project you are in. You can create new knowledge bases from the scratch, modify them and integrate existing knowledge bases into your project which are either local (that is, they are saved on your device) or remote (that is, if they are online). Note that this knowledge base page is distinct from the tab of the same name in the project settings (see <<Project Settings>> -> Knowledge Base).


* *Monitoring:* Here you can check the overall progress of your
project; see which user is working on or has finished which document; and toggle for each user the status of each document between *Done / In Progress* or between *New / Locked*. For details, see <<Monitoring>> in the main documentation.

NOTE: *Agreement:* The annotations of different annotators usually do not match perfectly. This aspect of difference / similarity is called agreement. For agreement, the measures provided in {product-name}, precision, recall and F1 are common.

* *Agreement*: On this page, you can calculate the so called annotator agreement.
*_Note:_* Only documents *marked as finished* by annotators (clicking on the
little lock on the annotation page) are taken into account.

* *Evaluation*: The evaluation page shows a learning courve diagram of
each recommender (see <<Project Settings>> -> Recommender).

* *Settings*: Here, you can organize, manage and adjust all the details of your project. Now, we will have a look on those you need to get started for your own projects.

This was the overview on what you can _do_ in each project.
Here is what elements each project _has_ - we find them in the Project Settings:


== First Annotations with {product-name}


In this section, we will make first annotations if you have not downloaded and imported an example project yet, we recommend to return to ___ and do so first.
In this section, no or little theory and background will be explained. In case you want to understand about the structure of a project before, we recommend reading the section <<Structure Of An Annotation Project>> first.


*Create your first annotations*

You may want to watch our https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp4AN3p23mQ&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&index=3&t=0s[*tutorial video „Overview“*] on how to create
annotations. But this guide, too, will lead you step by step.

* After logging in, the first thing you see is the *Project overview*. Here, you can see all the projects which you have access to. Right now, this will only be the example project. 

NOTE: *Creating an Own Project:* In this guide, we will use our example project. If you would like to create an own project, click on *create*, enter a project name and click on *save*. Use the *Projects* link at the top of the screen to return to the project overview and select the project you just created to work with it.

* Choose the example project by clicking on its name and you will be on the dashboard of this project.

image:getting_started_open_a_project.png[image,width=758,height=179]


NOTE: *Instructions to Example Projects:* In case of the example project, on the dashboard you also find instructions how to use it. This goes for our other example projects, too. You may use it instead or in addition to the next steps of this guide.

* In order to annotate, click on *Annotation* on the top left. You will be asked to open the document which you want to annotate. For this guide, choose _pets1.tsv_.

NOTE: *Annotations in Newly Imported Projects:* In the example project, you will see several annotations already. If you import projects or
also, single documents (see <<Project Settings>> →
Documents) without any annotations, there will be none. But in the
example projects, we have added some annotations already as examples. If you export a project (see  <<Project Settings>> →
Export) and import it again (as we just did with the example project), there will be the same annotations as before.

* After opening the document, select *Named entity* from the *Layer* dropdown menu on the right side of the screen to create your first annotation. Then, use the mouse to select a word in the *Annotation* area. When you release
the mouse button, the annotation will immediately be created and you can edit its details in the right sidebar (see next paragraph).

* All annotations will be saved automatically without clicking on a extra save-button (which is why there is none).


*Congratulations, you have created your first annotation!*


Now, let‘s examine the right panel to understand what we have done. You find the panel Layer on top and Annotation below.

In the *Layer*-dropdown, you can choose the layer you want to annotate with as
we just did. If you are not sure what layers are, check the box on _Layers And Features_ in the section <<Project Settings>>. In order to learn how to adjust and create them for your purpose, see the https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[main documentation]
, upper half→ User Guide.


In the *Annotation* panel, you see the details of a selected
annotation. 

image:getting_started_annotation_panel.png[image,width=288,height=517]

It shows the layer the annotation is made in (field „Layer"; here: _Named entity_)
and what part of the text has been annotated (field „Text“; here _wetterhoun_). Below, you can see and modify what has been entered for each of the so called *Features*. If you are not sure what features are, check the box on _Layers And Features_ in the section <<Project Settings>>. (Here: The layer _Named entity_ has the features "identifier" and "value". The identifier tells, to which entity in the knowledge base the annotated text refers to. In this case, it is the concept "Dog". The value tells if it is a Location (LOC), Person (PER), Organization (ORG) or, like here, other (OTH).) +
You may enter free text here or work with *Tagsets* to have a well
defined set of lables to enter so all of the users within one project will use the same lables. You can modify and create tagsets in the
project settings. See section <<Project Settings>> -> Tagsets and the https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[main documentation], upper half → User Guide.

The *Annotation Sidebar* at the left folds out when clicking
on the little arrow on top. 

image:getting_started_Sidebar_closed.png[image,width=462,height=460]
image:getting_started_Sidebar_open.png[image,width=479,height=542]

There are several features you might want to
check the https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[main documentation] for, upper half→ User Guide. Especially the *Recommender* section (the black speech bubble) in the sidebar is worth a look if you use recommenders
(see <<Project Settings>> -> Recommenders). E.g. you find
their measures and learning behaviours. Note the *Search* (the magnifier
glass): You can create or delete annotations on all or some of the
search results.

To get familiar with {product-name}, you may want to follow the
instructions for other example-projects, read the https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[main documentation] or explore {product-name} yourself, learning by doing.

One way or the other: *Have fun exploring*!

== Thank You
We hope this Getting-Started-Guide helped you with your first steps on {product-name} and it
gave you a general idea of how it works. For further reading or more details, we recommend the main documentation] which starts right after this paragraph.

Do not hestitate to contact us if you still struggle or have any questions. We
wish you success with your projects and you are welcome to let us know what you are working on.
