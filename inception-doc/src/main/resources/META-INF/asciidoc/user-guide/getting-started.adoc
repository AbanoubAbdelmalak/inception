= Getting Started
:toc:

This Getting-Started-Guide helps new users to install, start and work
with {product-name}. It gives a quick overview (estimated time for reading
only: approx. 20-30 minutes) on the key functionalities in order to get
familiar with the tool. It excludes special cases and details due to
simplicity and focus on the first steps. For further reading on any
topic, you will find lots of information in our guides, called
https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[documentation] (upper half→ User Guide). 

For quick overviews, also see our https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-[four tutorial videos] covering an Introduction, an Overview, Recommender Basics and Entity Linking. This guide will also refer to them at the appropriate place.



== Introduction

=== What can {product-name} be used for?

Also see our https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&time_continue=135&v=Ely8eBKqiSI&feature=emb_logo)[introduction video] for a
first impression on what {product-name} is.


* **{product-name} is a text-annotation enviroment **useful for various kinds
of annotation projects. It is a web application in which several users
can work on the same project and it can hold several annotation projects
at a time. The core functionality is annotating written
text. Annotations can be used both for linguistic and machine learning
concerns. image:Pictures/10000201000002B300000214EA8A80D173D21C1E.png[image,width=567,height=436]
In the following picture, you see an example where so called entities
have been annotated as person (PER), location (LOC), organization (ORG)
or other (OTH). These aspects are annotated on the so called annotation layer
Named Entity. We will go more into what layers are later on. INSERT LINK

* *What‘s more on {product-name}* beyond annotating written text is that it combines three key features in
one plattform: First, creating a corpus to be annotated (*Corpus Creation*);
second, annotating the corpus and merging annotations made by several annotators
(*Annotation, Curation*), and third, managing the knowledge used for annotating
(*Knowledge Bases*). You may want to do one, two or all three steps with
{product-name}. Also, it is extendable and adoptable to individual
requrements in all of these three areas. For example: You may
integrate a knowledgebase of your choice; create and modify your own
knowledge base; create and modify own layers and tagsets for annotation;
build own so called „recommenders“ which automatically suggest annotations to you so you will
work quicker and easier; .…
+
This guide focuses on enabeling you to annotate. For details on any
other topic, see our https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[main documentation] (upper half→ User Guide).

=== Contact Us And Tell Us What You Need

* {product-name} is still in developement, so you are welcome to give us
feedback and tell us your wishes and requirements. For any questions,
you are welcome to join our Google group https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/inception-users[„inception users“].
* If you have questions, you can
** reach us via the {product-name} users mailing list:
inception-users@googlegroups.com
** or open an issue on https://github.com/inception-project/inception/issues[Github].
** check our https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[main documentation] (upper half→ User Guide).

=== Know Our Documentation For Further Reading
Our main documentation consists of three parts: 

* If you only use {product-name} and do not develop, this *User
Guide* is the one of your choice. If it does not answer your questions, don't hesitate to contact us (see above). 

NOTE:  Whenever you find a *blue questionmark*-sign in {product-name}, you may click on it to find further explanation in this User Guide.

* For more installation details, see the https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[Admin Guide] (upper half→ *Admin Guide*).
* If you also develop, the https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[Developer Guide] (upper half→ *Developer Guide*) might be interesting for you.


== Installing and starting INCEpTION

=== Installing Java

In order to run {product-name}, you need to have Java installed on your system in version 8 or 
higher. If you do not have Java installed yet, please install the latest link:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle Java] or link:https://adoptopenjdk.net[OpenJDK].


=== Download and start {product-name}

* Download the .jar-file from our
https://inception-project.github.io/downloads/[website] by clicking on
https://github.com/inception-project/inception/releases/download/inception-app-0.16.1/inception-app-standalone-0.16.1.jar[{product-name}
0.16.1 (executable JAR)]. Wait a moment until it has been fully downloaded.
That is, until the name of the downloaded folder ends on „.jar“, not on
„.jar.part“ anymore.

NOTE: We recommend *working on the latest version* always since we
constantly add new features, improve usability and fix bugs. After
downloading the latest Version, your previous work will not be lost: In
the new version, you will find all your projects and documents like
before. Check the website, subscribe to github notifications or the
google group to to be notified when new versions are released.

NOTE: If double-clicking the JAR file does not start {product-name}, you might need to first *make the file executable*.


* Now, simply *double-click* on the downloaded .jar-file. After a
moment, a splash screen will display while the application is
initializing.

image:Pictures/100002010000042B0000022048C4B1144148DA3D.png[image,width=575,height=290]

Once the initialization is complete, a dialog appears. Here, you can
open the application in your default browser or shut it down again.

image:Pictures/10000201000002490000008B40781F820877441E.png[image,width=580,height=135]

* If you prefer the *command line*, you may enter this command there
instead of the last point:
+
$ java -jar inception-app-standalone-0.10.0.jar
+
In this case, no splash screen will start. Just enter
http://localhost:8080/[_http://localhost:8080_] in you browser.
* The first time you start the application, a default user with the
*username „admin“* and the *password „admin“* is created. Use this username
and password to log in to the application after opening it in your
browser.
* In case you are interested in more installation details, see the 
https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[Admin
Guide] (upper half→ Admin Guide).


==== First Annotations with INCEpTION


In this section, we will make first annotations and therefore use an
already existing annotation projec, a so called „example project“. We
will not go into theory and background here but go straight ahead. In case you want to understand about the structure of a project first, we recommend reading the section <<Anatomy of an annotation project>> first.



*Download an example project for your first annotations*

We created some annotation projects as examples of how to annotate with
{product-name}. You find them in the section https://inception-project.github.io/example-projects/[Example Projects] on our
website.

image:Pictures/10000201000002E0000000C72F4B75B5F9EAE8D0.png[image,width=636,height=128]

* To follow this Guide, please *download* the _Interactive Concept
Linking_ project. It constists of two documents about pets. The first one contain
some annotations as an example, the second one is meant to be your playground. It has originally been created to show an example for concept linking but in every project, you can create any kinds of annotations.
 
NOTE: *Concept Linking* is the kind of annotation telling whether the annotated text part refers to a
Person ( in {product-name}, this is per default done as PER), Organization (ORG), Location (LOC) or something else
(other: OTH)

image:Pictures/100002010000045200000212EF2BD2132E62C7BC.png[image,width=643,height=295]

* In order to *import our example project*, after logging into
{product-name}, click on the blue folder on the top right (next to „Import
project archives“) and browse for the example project you have
downloaded before. Finally, click the grey upload button right next to
the blue folder to upload the selected project. The project has now been added.

*Create your first annotations*

You may want to watch our https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp4AN3p23mQ&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&index=3&t=0s[*tutorial video „Overview“*] on how to create
annotations. But this guide, too, will lead you step by step.

* After logging in, the first thing you see is the *Project overview*. Here, you can see all the projects which you have access to. Right now, this will only be the example project. 

NOTE: In this guide, we will use our example project. If you want to *create an own project* later on, click on *create*, enter a name for your project and press *save*. Use the *Projects* link at the top of the screen to return to the project overview and select the project you just created to work with it.

* Choose the example project by clicking on its name and you will be on the dashboard of this project.

NOTE: In case of the example project, here on the dashboard you also find *instructions* how to use it. You may use it instead or in addition to the next steps of this guide.

* In order to annotate, click on *Annotation* on the top left. You will be asked to open the document which you want to annotate. Choose _pets1.tsv_.

NOTE: You will see several annotations already. If you import projects (or
also, single documents, as we see in section <<Anatomy of an annotation project>> →
documents) without any annotations, there will be none. But in the
example projects, we have added some annotations already to show you
some examples of annotations.

* After opening the document, select *Named entity* from the *Layer* dropdown menu on the right side of the screen to create your first annotation. Then, use the mouse to select a word in the *Annotation* area. When you release
the mouse button, the annotation will immediately be created and you can edit its details in the right
sidebar.


*Congratulations! You have created your first annotation!*

Now, let‘s examine the right panel to understand what we have done:


* You find the field „Layer“ on top and „Annotation“ below. In the
*Layer*-dropdown, you can choose the layer you want to annotate with as
we yust did. By the layer, you choose the kind of annotation you make.
For example, we used the POS (Part of Speech) layer before to annotate
what is a verb/noun/adjective/… On the

NOTE: This is a Box explaining some layers

* You find several default layers like Part Of Speech or Named Entity
already. You can also adjust them and create own layers in the project
settings (we will deal with the project settings later on). INCEpTION
supports span layers (annotating a span in the text, e.g. from the 51th
character („letter“) in the text to the 55th) and relation layers
(annotating two span annotations). For span layers, the default is to
always annotate one or more tokens („words“) but you can adjust to
character level or sentence level. For more details, see the main
documentation (
https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide).
** In the field *Annotation* below, you see the details of a selected
annotation. It shows the layer the annotation is made on (field „layer“)
and what has been annotated (field „text“). Below, you can see and
modify what has been entered for each of the so called *Features*. Each
layer has different features. E.g. on the Part of Speech-layer, the
PosValue-feature tells if the token is a noun/verb/adjective/… See the
main documentation for the different feature types and how to adjust
features for your individual task
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide).
+
You may enter free text here or work with *Tagsets* to have a well
defined set of values to enter. You can modify and create tagsets in the
project settings (section „Tagsets“) which we will deal with later. See
our main documentation on how to create and modify tagsets
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide).
* In the **Annotation Sidebar **at the left (it folds out when clicking
on the little arrow on top) there are several features you might want to
check the main documentation for
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide). Especially the *Recommender* section (the
black speech bubble) is worth a look if you use recommenders
(recommenders will be explained later on in this guide). E.g. you find
their measures and learning behaviours. Note the *Search* (the magnifier
glass): You can create or delete annotations on all or some of the
search results.
* To get familiar with INCEpTION, you may want to follow the
instructions for your example-project or explore INCEpTION yourself, learning by doing. You find the instructions on the website where you
downloaded the project as well as on the dashboard in INCEpTION.
+
One way or the other: *Have fun exploring*!

ERGÄNZE Tagsets:

INCEpTION comes with many different built-in layers and annotation
schemes. You can explore these in the Project settings under Layer and
Tagset.

 +
ich würd vorschlagen den leser drauf hinzuweisen dass er eigene tagsets
anlegen kann und auch soll

es gibt built-in layer - die kann man auch nicht löschen

es gibt keine built-in tagsets in dem sinne dass man sie nicht löschen
kann

aber es gibt "default" tagsets - die halt per default angelegt werden
damit der benutzer einen startpunkt hat

=== Anatomy of an annotation project

If you may have different projects in {product-name} at the same time. Each
project consist of

* One or more *documents* to annotate
* *Users* to work on the project
* *Layers* to annotate with
* Optional: one or more *Knowledge Base/s*
* Optional: *Recomenders* to automatically suggest annotations
* Optional: *Guidelines* for your team

You find all of these in the project *settings* which are explaned in
the next part.

In order to work with your own projects, you might want to understand
the anatomy of an {product-name} project. Let‘s see what the dashboard
(clicking on the dashboard button on the top) provides: As a Project
Manager of a project, you see all of the following sub pages (roles and
rights will be presented later on in this guide). For details on each
section, check the main documentation
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide).

* *Annotation*: We were here before. Here, you can make your
annotations just like before.
* *Curation*: If several annotators work on a project, you may want a
curator to finally decide which annotations to accept. Everyone with
curation rights (see below) within this project can curate. All other users
do not have access to nor see this page. Only documents marked as
finished by at least one annotator can be curated. For details on how to
courate, see the main documentation
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide) or just try it out:

** Add another fake user (see below)
** Create some annotations in any document
** Mark the document as finished: Just click on the lock on top.
** Log out and log in again as the fake user.
** In the very same document, make some annotations exactly like before
but also some which are different. Mark the document as finished.
** Log in as any user with couration rights (e.g. the „admin“ user we
used before), enter the couration page and explore how to courate: You
see the automatic merge on top (what was equal from both users is being
accepted already) and the annotations of each of the users below.
Differences are highlightet. You can accept an annotation by clicking on
it. You can also create new annotations.
* *Knowledge Base*: On this sub page, you can manage and create your
knowledge bases for this project. You can create new ones from the
scratch, modify existing ones and integrate remote or local knowledge
bases into your project.
* *Monitoring:* Here you can check the overall progress of your
project; which user is working on or has finished which document; and
for each user, you can toggle the status of each document between
***Done****/****In Progress ****or between **New / Locked**.***
* *Agreement*: On this page, you can calculate the so called annotator agreement. That is, the agreement of you the work of your different annotators. Different measures for agreement are provided.
_Note:_ Only documents marked as finished by annotators (clicking on the
little lock on the annotation page) are taken into account.
* *Evaluation*: The evaluation page shows a learning courve diagram of
each recommender (we will explain recommenders later on on this guide).
* *Settings*: Here, you can organize, manage and adjust all details of your project. We will have a look now on those you need to get started for your own projects. For a quick overview on the settings, you might want to watch our tutorial video
„Overview“:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp4AN3p23mQ&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&index=3&t=0s.

* Now, let‘s have a look at the *Settings* (again, for details on any
section/topic mentioned, please check the main documentation
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide).** **You find differenat tabs:

* In the section **Documents, **you may upload your files to be
annotated. Make sure that the format selected (see the dropdown on the
right) is the same as the file.
* In the section **Users, **you may add users to your project and change
their rights in this project. You can only add existing users here from
the dropdown (left).
** In order to *add new users* so they can be chosen from this dropdown,
click on „*administration*“- button in the very top right corner and
select section *Users* on the left. For *user roles* (within the whole
instance of INCEpTION) see the
https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/latest/developer-guide[developer guide].
** *Selecting a user from the dropdown* in the project settings section
*Users*, you can check/unchek the *user‘s rights *(they are different
from roles and count for this project only) on the right side. Any
combination is possible and the user will always have _all_ rights
combined.

* In the section **Layers, **you may modify existing layers to use for
your annotation and create own layers. In case you do not want to work
on default layers only, we highly recommend reading the main
documentation on layers
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide).
* In the section **Knowledge Base, **you can change the settings for the
knowledge bases used in your project, you can import local and remote
knowledgebases into your project and you can create an own empty knowledge base. The latter will be empty at first. It can be filled at the knowledge base page ( -> _Dashboard_, -> _Knowledge base_), not here in the settings. In order to do import or create a knowledge base, just click the „create“-button and follow the wizzard according to your demands.
** Note that you can have several knowledge bases in your INCEpTION
instance but you can choose for every project which one(s) to use. Using
many knowledge bases in one project will slow down the performance.
** Via the *Dashboard* (click the Dashboard-button at the top centre),
you can get to the knowledge base page. This is a page different from
the one in the project settings where you can modify and work on your
knowledge bases.
** For details on knowledge bases, see our main documentation
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide) or our tutorial video „Overview“ which also
talks about knowledge bases quickly:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp4AN3p23mQ&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&index=3&t=0s..
If you like to explore a knowledge base learning by doing, you may
download and import the example project _Interactive Concept Linking_:
https://inception-project.github.io/example-projects/concept-linking/
which contains a small knowledge base.
* In the section **Recommenders, **you can create and modify your
recommenders. They learn from your behaviour and give automatic
suggestions for creating annotations. For details on this topic to broad
for a getting-started-guide, see our main documentation
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide) or our tutorial video „Recommender Basics“:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz3Hs8Lyoeg&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-&index=3
.

* In the *Guidelines* section, you may import files with annotation guidelines files for your
team to read and to check quickly while working. On the annotation page
(→ _dashboard_ → _annotation_ → open any document), annotators can quickly
look them up by clicking on the guidelines button on the top (it looks
like a book).

* In the **Export
**section, you can export your project partially or wholly. Projects
which have been exported can be imported again in INCEpTION the way we
did before with the example project: at the start page with the *Import* button. We recommend
exporting projects on a regular basis in order to have a backup. For the
different formats, their strengths and weaknesses, check our main
documentation
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide). We recommend using WebAnno TSV x.x (where
x.x. is the highest number available, e.g. 3.2) whenever possible. Since
it has been created specially for this application, it ill provide all
features required best. However, many other formats are provided.

We hope this guide helped you with your first steps on INCEpTION and it
gave you a general idea of hiw INCEpTION works. As mentioned before, our
main documentation
(https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[https://inception-]https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/[project.github.io/documentation/]
, upper half→ User Guide) provides deep information on every issue.
Do not hestitate to contact us if you struggle or have any questions. We
wish you success and fun with your projects. Let us know how you are
doing!
