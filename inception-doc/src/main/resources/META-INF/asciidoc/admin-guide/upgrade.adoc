== Upgrade

=== Exporting/importing

* Log in to the application and export all the projects that you wish to migrate using the *Export* pane in the project settings
* Move your {product-name} home folder to a safe location and create a new home folder in the old location
* Copy the *settings.properties* and *formats.properties* (if present) back from your moved folder
* Start the new {product-name} version to initialize the database
* Recreate the users
** If you are using MySQL
*** create a new database and update the *settings.properties* accordingly
*** use link:http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysqldump.html[mysqldump] to dump the tables `users` and `authorities` from the old database and load it back into the new database
** If you are not using MySQL, you have to recreate the users manually
* Restart {product-name} and import the previously exported projects

=== In-place update

This method should work when updating only a bugfix version, e.g. from 2.0.9 to 2.0.10. When performing a minor or major update, better use the exporting/importing method above.  

==== Backup your data

* Make a copy of your {product-name} home folder
* If you are using MySQL, make a backup of your {product-name} database, e.g. using the link:http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysqldump.html[mysqldump] command.

==== Standalone service
* Stop the {product-name} service
* Replace the `inception.jar` file with the new version
* Ensure that the file has the right owner/group (usually `www-data`)
* Start the {product-name} service again

==== Separate Tomcat
* While Tomcat is running, delete the old WAR from your `webapps` folder
* Wait until Tomcat has automatically deleted the {product-name} folder 
* Stop Tomcat
* Place the new WAR file into your `webapps` folder
* Start Tomcat
