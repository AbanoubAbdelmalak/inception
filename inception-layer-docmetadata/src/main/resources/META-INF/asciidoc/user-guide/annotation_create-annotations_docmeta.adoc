= Document metadata

To manage document-level annotations, access the **Document metadata** sidebar on the annotation
page.

NOTE: This is an experimental feature not recommended for serious use. However, you can try it out
      and enable it by adding `documentmetadata.enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file.
