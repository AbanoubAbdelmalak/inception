Predictions made by a specific recommender can be deleted by removing the corresponding recommender
in the  <<sect_projects_recommendation, Project Settings>>. Clicking *Reset* in the _Workflow_ area
will remove all predictions, however it will also remove all hand-made annotations.

Clicking the speech bubble on the left opens the recommendation sidebar. There one can set the
maximum number of recommendations that are displayed for each token. Also, by ticking *Show all*,
all recommendations are shown, even if an annotation at the given position already exists. In order
to save the new values, press *Submit*.
