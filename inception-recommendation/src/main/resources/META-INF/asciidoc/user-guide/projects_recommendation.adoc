=== Recommendation
Recommenders are designed to facilitate the annotation of documents by learning from existing annotations.
After clicking on *Recommendation*, you are displayed a new pane in which you can add new recommenders
by clicking on the button *Create*. You have to select the layer, feature and the classification tool.
The recommenders are trained every time you create, update or delete an annotation;
and evaluated every second time. During recommender evaluation the f-score of each recommender is calcultated,
and recommenders with a lower f-score than their threshold will not be selected for the next training step.
By making a tick on the checkbox next to *Always active* or leaving the threshold at 0,
you can choose to skip f-score evaluation to ensure that the recommender runs at all times.

To remove a recommender, click on the recommender and then on *Delete*. This will remove all predictions by this recommender.

==== ClassificationTool types

* String Matcher
- This recommender stores <token, feature.value> mappings in a dictionary and predicts the same
feature.value for each token with the same surface form in the project.

* Multi-Token Sequence Classifier (OpenNlp Name Finder)
- This recommender makes predictions based on a maximum entropy model.
It utilizes the Apache OpenNlp library.

* Token Sequence Classifier (OpenNlp POS Tagger)
- A part-of-speech tagger that uses maximum entropy. Tries to predict whether
words are nouns, verbs, or any of 70 other POS tags depending on their
surrounding context. This recommender is specifically for the POS layer.
It utilizes the Apache OpenNlp library.

* Named Entity Linker
- A recommender specific to the _identifier_ feature of the Named Entity layer.
It predicts the 3 highest ranked candidate entities for each each token annotated as Named Entity.
