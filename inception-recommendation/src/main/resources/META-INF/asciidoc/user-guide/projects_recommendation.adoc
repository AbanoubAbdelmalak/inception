= Recommenders

Recommender provide annotation support by predicting potential labels. These can be either accepted
or rejected by the user. The recommender learn from this interaction to further improve the quality
of predictions.

Recommender are trained every time an annotation is created, updated or deleted. In order to determine
whether the annotations are good enough, recommender are evaluated on the annotation data.

Recommender can be configured in the *Project Settings* under the *Recommenders* tab. To create a new
recommender, click *Create*. Then, the layer, feature and the classifier type has to be selected.

Recommender can be enabled and disabled. This behaviour is configured by the *Enabled* checkbox.
Recommender that are disabled are not used for training and prediction and are not evaluated.

The *Activation strategy* describes when a recommender should be used for prediction. Right now,
there are two options: either set a threshold on the evaluation score (if the evaluation score is
lower than the threshold, the recommender is not used for predicting until annotations have changed)
or always enable it.

Some recommender are capable of generating more than one annotation per token or span. The maximum
number of predictions can be configured by the *Max. recommendations* field.

Sometimes it is desirable to not train on all documents, but only on e.g. finished documents. In order
to control documents in which state should be used for training, the respective ones can be selected
from the *States used for training*.

To save a recommender, click *Save*. To abort, click *Cancel*. To edit an existing recommender, it
can be selected from the left pane, edited and then saved. Recommender can be deleted by clicking on
*Delete*. This will also remove all predictions by this recommender.
