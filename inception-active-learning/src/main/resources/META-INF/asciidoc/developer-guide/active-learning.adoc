= Active Learning

The active learning module aims to guide the user through recommendations in such a way that the
the judgements made by the user are most informative to the recommenders. The goal is to reduce
the required user interactions to a minium. The module consists of the following classes and
interfaces:

* The `ActiveLearningService` interface and its default implementation `ActiveLearningServiceImpl`
  which provide access to the ranked suggestions.
* The `ActiveLearningStrategy` interface which allows plugging in different ranking strategies.
* The `UncertaintySamplingStrategy` class which is currently the only ranking strategy available.
* The `ActiveLearningSidebar` class which provides the active learning sidebar for the annotation
  page.
