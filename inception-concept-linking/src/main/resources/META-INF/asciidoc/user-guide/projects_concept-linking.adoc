=== Interactive Concept Linking
The user can setup a local or remote KB for his project in the settings, which includes the configuration
for the various IRIs. The necessary IRIs are as follows.

* Class IRI: Declares a resource as a class.
* Subclass IRI: Allows the declaration of hierarchies of classes.
* Type IRI: Indicates that resource A is an instance of resource B.
* Description IRI: Indicates that resource A is a description of concept.

For concept linking, the only relevant IRI is the Description IRI.
Checking “Supports Concept Linking” will activate the disambiguation pipeline.
Otherwise, all entities from the KB are displayed in alphabetical order, as it was done before.

A fully configured Knowledge Base for concept linking can be seen in the screenshot below.

Documentation about the NamedEntityLinker can be found in the <<sect_projects_recommendation, Project Settings>> .
