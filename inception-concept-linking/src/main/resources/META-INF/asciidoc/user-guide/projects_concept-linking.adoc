=== Concept Linking
The user can setup a local or remote KB for his project in the settings, which includes the
configuration for the various IRIs. The necessary IRIs are as follows.

* Class IRI: Declares a resource as a class.
* Subclass IRI: Allows the declaration of hierarchies of classes.
* Type IRI: Indicates that resource A is an instance of resource B.
* Description IRI: Indicates that resource A is a description of resource B.

For Concept Linking, the only relevant IRI is the Description IRI, which needs to be selected to enable Concept Linking functionality.
Furthermore, the KB must support full-text-search. It is planned to enable full-text-search for local KBs in the next release.
Checking “Supports Concept Linking” will activate the disambiguation pipeline.
If it is not checked, Concept Linking still works, but all concepts from the KB are displayed
in alphabetical order.

A Knowledge Base configured for Concept Linking can be seen in the screenshot below.
