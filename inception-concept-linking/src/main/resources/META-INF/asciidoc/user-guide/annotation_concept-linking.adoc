=== Concept Linking
==== Interactive Concept Linking
When the user wants to link a mention, he marks it and starts typing the name of the concept.
This triggers a pass through the entity linking pipeline and retrieves a ranked list of candidates,
which is displayed to the user in the form of a drop-down menu.
In order to enable a user to select the correct concept, it is crucial for him to receive textual
information about the candidates in question. This is realized by showing an overlay text box with
descriptions retrieved from the KB.

If the typed string matches the marked surface form, the query is executed with the whole
surface form as query string. Otherwise, a query is started every time the user types something new
in the concept selector field. That way, even mentions that are lexically different from the names
under which they are known in the KB can be linked, as visible in the screenshot below.

==== Automated Concept Suggestions

The Named Entity Linker (NEL) displays three highest-ranked candidates as suggestions boxes
over each mention annotated as Named Entity.
The user can accept, reject or ignore these suggestions.
If a suggestion is rejected, it is not showed again.
It is possible to combine the NEL with the existing Named Entity Recommenders for the NE type,
which makes the annotation process even faster.
The recommender needs to be set up in the <<sect_projects_recommendation, Project Settings>>.
