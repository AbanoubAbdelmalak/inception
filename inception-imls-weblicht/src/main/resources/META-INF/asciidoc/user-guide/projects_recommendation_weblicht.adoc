== WebLicht

In order to create a WebLicht recommender, you first need to obtain an API key: https://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/WaaS/apikey

Next, log in to WebLicht to build a processing chain: https://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/

Start with one of the example documents. Then build you pipeline using either the easy or advanced
modes. Once you are done, use the  **Download chain** button to download the processing chain
definition.

Now, create a new WebLicht recommender in {product-name}. Enter the API key you obtained in the 
previous step. Before you can upload the process chain definition file, you need to save the recommender.
