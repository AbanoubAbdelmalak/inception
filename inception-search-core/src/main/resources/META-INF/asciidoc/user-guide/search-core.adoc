== Search

The search module allows to search for words, passages and annotations made in the 
documents of a given project. Currently, the default search is provided by *Mtas*
(Multi Tier Annotation Search), a Lucene/Solr based search and indexing mechanism developed by
Meertens Institut (https://meertensinstituut.github.io/mtas).

To perform a search, access the search sidebar located at the left of the screen, write a query and
press the *Search* button. The results are shown below the query in a KWIC (keyword in context)
style grouped by document. Clicking on a result will open the match in the main annotation editor.

The search only considers documents in the current project and only matches annotations made by
the current user.

Clicking on the search settings button (cog wheel) shows additional options:

* **Current document only** limits the search to the document shown in the main annotation editor.
  When switching to another document, the result list does not change automatically - the search
  button needs to be pressed again in order to show results from the new document.
* **Rebuild index** may help fixing search issues (e.g. no or only partial results), in particular
  after upgrading to a new version of {product-name}. Note that this process may take quite some
  time depending on the number of documents in the project.
