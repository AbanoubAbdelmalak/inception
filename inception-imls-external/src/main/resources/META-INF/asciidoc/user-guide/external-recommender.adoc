== External recommender

This guide describes how to set up external recommenders.

=== Setting up neuralweb

The currently supported external classifier is *neuralweb*. Set it up according to its documentation and install a model. The easist way to do this is to rename the model to `arg_model.h5` and put it into `models/default`. Start the server with `python app.py`.

=== Setting up INCEpTION

Create a new project. Add a new layer called `ArgLayer` to it. Make sure that it is a span layer. Activate `Allow multiple tokens` and `Allow crossing sentence boundaries`.

Create a new feature for the layer you just created. It is called `ArgF` and its type is `Primitive:String`.

Add the external recommender to the just created layer `ArgLayer` and set it to always active.
